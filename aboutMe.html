                The first fact about me that sets me apart from the majority of students at Texas A&M is that
                I come from a small town in New Hampshire. Growing up in New England certainly
                had its ups and downs. One pro of living there was being surrounded by the beatiful scenery as shown in
                the right-most picture. Especially in the winter, it was always nice to wake up to a blizzard and then
                have school be cancelled. Of course, when I say blizzard, I truly mean it and not some half-inch snow
                that can occur here in Texas that warrants a cancellation of school. I'm talking 2-3 feet of snow and 
                instead of staying safe inside, my friends and I go for a long ski day at the down-the-road skiway 
                (<a style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/skiway/">Dartmouth Skiway</a>).
                Another perk of winter in my middle school days that always seems to astonish people is that we would
                actually leave school early on Thursdays to go take ski lessons at the skiway. It's a pretty wild concept
                thinking about it now, but that was the norm back then.
