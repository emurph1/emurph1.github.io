&lt;h1 id="what-is-the-exam" >What is the exam?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#what-is-the-exam">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>&lt;em>The GIAC Incident Handler certification validates a practitioner&amp;rsquo;s ability to detect, respond, and resolve computer security incidents using a wide range of essential security skills. GCIH certification holders have the knowledge needed to manage security incidents by understanding common attack techniques, vectors and tools, as well as defend against and respond to such attacks when they occur.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The certification is mainly for those looking to or are working on the defensive (or blue) side of cybersecurity. All in all, I highly recommend it as it exposes you to the many tools there are for defensive/incident response while also giving you insight on what bad actors may be trying to do on your network and how to detect it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>106 questions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>11 Labs (Cyber Live)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 hours to take the exam&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Min passing score of 70%&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="my-process-studying-for-the-exam" >My process studying for the exam:
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#my-process-studying-for-the-exam">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With SANS Live Online courses, you take the course over 5 or 6 days and then have 2 weeks until you are able to schedule your exam. During the class itself, it is very lecture-based and for me (with 2 years of student security analyst and being President of the Texas A&amp;amp;M Cybersecurity Club), I decided to spend the lecture time working on the labs. My Lead at work had told me that the trick to the SANS certficiation exams is to know the labs inside and out, so I took that to heart and focused on them. I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to sound like a know-it-all, but I personally cannot learn by just watching lectures for 8hrs for 5 days and a lot of what was talked about was introductory into incident response, which I have already done a lot of those job duties in the past and in my current position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then of course, as anyone who has taken a SANS course before, &lt;em>indexing&lt;/em> is the most important part. ALL SANS certification exams are &lt;em>OPEN BOOK&lt;/em>, but if you think you can take the exam without having made an index or even copping one from someone else, you will most likely fail. For GCIH, there are 5 main books and another book about the CTF (Capture the Flag compeition at the end of the course where you can win a pin if you are the top team!). I decided to take a proactive step with my index by making it as I listened to the lecture and did the labs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-most-helpful-tips-when-creating-an-index" >The most helpful tips when creating an index?
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-most-helpful-tips-when-creating-an-index">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h4>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Do it during the lecture and labs (or at least write some notes down on terms or commands you don&amp;rsquo;t know)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reference the cheatsheets provided and extract the commands or info you saw during the course and put into your index&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure there is a clear distinction between referencing the books and the lab books (and labs)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like having a short description per term, but that is personal opinion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once I made my index, I took my first practice exam mostly without my index (I caved as I stumbled on a question or two during the practice exam). I did pass the practice exam with a 76% (need a 70% to pass), so I felt pretty good about taking the real one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did, however, go back and re-read the books as well as look at the extra resources within the course materials ISO for another 2 weeks then went and took my exam on Sept 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended up passing with an 83% and I can say that there are things on the exam that were not very in-depthly talked about in any books. That being said, my biggest takeaway with GCIH and maybe SANS certs in general (this is my first SANS exam) is that you should be doing some extra research on topics especially if you get to a point where while you are studying, you think &amp;ldquo;oh I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;ll be on the test&amp;rdquo; and just look it up and put it in your index in case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, I felt like the exam focused a lot more on commands and specifically commands within cloud environments. This topic was briefly explained in the books and labs let alone commands for a specific cloud service provider. However, it is on the cheatsheet that I of course forgot to print the cloud one&amp;hellip;. Just don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake I did!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all though, the certification is a great resume booster and the tools that are mentioned in the course were current to todays world and some of which I was not familiar with. So for someone trying to get into the defense/blue team cyber industry and are willing to spend a ton of money on a certification, this certfication is a great one to have.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Yes so this really should have been the first certifcation that I went for, but um life happens ya know?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intended to get this certification during my Sophomore year of university&amp;hellip; I promise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why did it take you so long?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>My work first sponsored me to get CompTIA CySA+, so I focused on that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I got a lot more busy than I thought with personal life and school life&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I got the President position for Texas A&amp;amp;M Cybersecurity Club.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I was just lazy and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go for it despite having a voucher for it.&lt;/li>

&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I am probably not the best person to talk to about studying for this exam, but I am still gonna note my process here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So originally, I was going to take the Security+ exam and had already started studying for it when my work told me that they were sponsoring the student workers to take the CySA+ exam. Naturally, I thought I could study for both, but then my summer got busy and then the Fall semester rolled around, so I then told myself I would focus on CySA+ for the winter break. Winter break came and I did some studying… I counted doing the TryHackMe as studying and I did some PracticeLabs. Once the next semester began, I finally sat down and scheduled my exam for the end of March.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought the Jason Dion Udemy course and started watching those videos. I took his practice test in the middle of it and got like a 50%, so I was like oh dear I really need to study more…. Winter storm Uri comes and I instead binge-watched a TV show instead of studying (LOL). So the two weeks before my exam I spent watching the Dion videos and other YouTube videos on the exam, then I actually took the exam and passed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, overall, my advice is to be diligent with your studying, take multiple practice exams, and if you have the chance to work as an analyst or anything, do it. I think a big reason as to why I passed the exam was because of my work experience as a student analyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The test itself was very long. You get almost 3 hours and it’s through PearsonVue proctoring. I had to clear my entire desk and not speak during the entire exam. I didn’t realize I couldn’t talk to myself (which I do a lot) and the proctor sent me a message and was like “please don’t talk” and so I shut up haha. I finished the exam with a good amount of time left over, but I still spent at least another hour just re-checking the exam because you can go back to previous questions and stuff. I think I rechecked everything three times before I submitted the exam. And since the exam was online and via the computer, I got my results immediately. It is the same way the Sec+ is formatted. So, you will know your results after you submit and then fill out a short survey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would recommend this certification exam if you are looking to get a job as a security analyst/blue team-type work because it is a good one for that specific role. If you are into red team work, the opposite exam would be the CompTIA Pentest+ exam. Either way, having these certifications on your resume help in getting the job you want and is a leg up against other candidates.&lt;/p>
