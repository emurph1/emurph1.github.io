&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With all the links in this doc, I highly encourage you to also watch those YouTube Videos and read all the links that are in here because all of it helps in not only studying for the exam, but knowing everything about the exam (the structure, who takes it, why you should take it, what content it has, etc.)&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I am probably not the best person to talk to about studying for this exam, but I am still gonna note my process here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So originally, I was going to take the Security+ exam and had already started studying for it when my work told me that they were sponsoring the student workers to take the CySA+ exam. Naturally, I thought I could study for both, but then my summer got busy and then the Fall semester rolled around, so I then told myself I would focus on CySA+ for the winter break. Winter break came and I did some studying… I counted doing the TryHackMe as studying and I did some PracticeLabs. Once the next semester began, I finally sat down and scheduled my exam for the end of March.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought the Jason Dion Udemy course and started watching those videos. I took his practice test in the middle of it and got like a 50%, so I was like oh dear I really need to study more…. Winter storm Uri comes and I instead binge-watched a TV show instead of studying (LOL). So the two weeks before my exam I spent watching the Dion videos and other YouTube videos on the exam, then I actually took the exam and passed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, overall, my advice is to be diligent with your studying, take multiple practice exams, and if you have the chance to work as an analyst or anything, do it. I think a big reason as to why I passed the exam was because of my work experience as a student analyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The test itself was very long. You get almost 3 hours and it’s through PearsonVue proctoring. I had to clear my entire desk and not speak during the entire exam. I didn’t realize I couldn’t talk to myself (which I do a lot) and the proctor sent me a message and was like “please don’t talk” and so I shut up haha. I finished the exam with a good amount of time left over, but I still spent at least another hour just re-checking the exam because you can go back to previous questions and stuff. I think I rechecked everything three times before I submitted the exam. And since the exam was online and via the computer, I got my results immediately. It is the same way the Sec+ is formatted. So, you will know your results after you submit and then fill out a short survey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would recommend this certification exam if you are looking to get a job as a security analyst/blue team-type work because it is a good one for that specific role. If you are into red team work, the opposite exam would be the CompTIA Pentest+ exam. Either way, having these certifications on your resume help in getting the job you want and is a leg up against other candidates.&lt;/p>
