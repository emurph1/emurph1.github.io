            Outside of the grueling coursework at A&M, I enjoy giving back to my community in multiple ways. The first and most enjoyable servitude that I do is volunteering at
            the Aggieland Humane Society. I love animals, especially dogs. If I could have a dog in my apartment, I 1000% would. Going to the Aggieland Humane is not too big of a commitment
            during the school year, so it is the perfect break from courses or work. This type of volunteering is also what I aspire to do later in life (wherever I may be).
        </p>

            Another volunteer activity that I have done in the past (back home), was at the <a href="https://uppervalleyhaven.org/" target="_blank"style="text-decoration: underline;">Upper Valley Haven</a>. It is a shelter for the homeless around my home area and neighboring towns.
            In highschool, I would go to the Haven and cook a couple meals for a large group of people. On one of those times, I cooked spicy chicken tacos with mexican rice and it was nice
            to speak with other community members.
