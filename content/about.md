Hello, Emily here! 

<img src="/posts/images/about/moi.jpg" alt="headshot" width="400" height="400"/>

I am currently a senior at Texas A&M University studying computer science with a minor in cybersecurity. I am originally from New England and chose Texas A&M because I love the Aggie Spirit and the great state of Texas!

My career passions and goals are within the cybersecurity industry. Technology has always been an interest of mine since the first time I upgraded my old Macbook Pro's hard drive to a solid state drive. Once I found out about cybersecurity (thank you, Mom!), I knew that it was what I wanted to do and I have been working towards that ever since! I currently work as the Student Leader for the [Cybersecurity Apprenticeship Program](cap.tamu.edu) at A&M and within that role, I work as a Security Operations Student Analyst. I also am a [CyberCorps Scholariship for Service](sfs.org) scholar and upon graduation, I hope to secure a job within the Federal Government.

At school and besides academics, you can find me leading the best student organization on campus: the [Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club](https://cybr.club/). A lot of my free time is spent within the club; I absolutely adore everyone in the club and am so grateful for the club as it has helped me achieve and continuously improve my cybersecurity skills.

Now, outside of school or career, I love being with my family or friends and doing just about anything. Most of the time, you will find me trying out new recipes with friends, playing videogames (especially Super Smash Bros Ultimate), or hanging out at home reading or lounging about.
