#### I finally got my CompTIA Security+.

Yes so this really should have been the first certifcation that I went for, but um life happens ya know?

I intended to get this certification during my Sophomore year of university... I promise.

**Why did it take you so long?**

1. My work first sponsored me to get CompTIA CySA+, so I focused on that.
2. I got a lot more busy than I thought with personal life and school life 
3. I got the President position for Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club.
4. I was just lazy and didn't want to go for it despite having a voucher for it.
